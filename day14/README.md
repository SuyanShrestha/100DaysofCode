Today I started learning some basics on JS. I will be jumping back and forth on practicing different CSS designs too during this learning path. 
Here's what I learnt today:
- background history on JS and how modern js came to rise
- Execution context and how the code actually gets executed in the call stack.
- variables (how let, var and const differs from each other)
- typeof operator
- number to string and string to number conversions
- string indexing and useful string methods such as slice, toUpperCase, toLowerCase, trim, etc
